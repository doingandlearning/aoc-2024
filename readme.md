# Advent of Code 2024

Deno this year. Let's see how this goes.

I know TypeScript well and have done some work with Deno. It'll be interesting to see if there is much difference.

As in previous years, there are three files for each day:
- dayx.ts
- dayx.test
- dayx.input

The input file is in the .gitignore so if you want to use my solutions you'll need to add those files with your own input.

## Day 1

A gentle start as normal. I don't think I make it past day 12 often but I'm going to give it a good shot this year. 

TIL Deno has a number of tools for reading files and a specific `readTextFile` function which is nicer than needing to import `node:fs/promises`.

## Day 2

I didn't read the question properly and missed some of the edge cases in both parts initially. Got there in the end but took longer that I might have liked.

I updated my Deno running harness. Deno.run() is a great way to run another shell command - to do this in Node I'd have to use a child_process. This was a lot cleaner!

## Day 3

Who said regular expression were useless? Thought I was going made for part 2 but the input had changed. If you know regex this one was pretty straightforward.

No new Deno features used today - glad that all of the JS/TS knowledge is transferable though.

## Day 4

The start of the 2x2 grids - I very rarely use these skills outside of AOC problems these days!

Wanted to use the debugger and with the Deno extension in VSCode it just worked! üë®‚Äçüç≥üíã
